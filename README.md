# unconditional-GAN
This work was based on the tutorial of the book: Generative Adversarial Networks with Python from Jason Brownlee. Thank you very much for the great tutorial.
This repo already included my file save "generator.h5" after training and can be used for further prediction of Fashion-MNIST.
